## SWI-Prolog version 9

The SWI-Prolog 9.0  consolidates many improvements of  the 8.x series.
This major release mainly adds  and improves features.  Upgrading from
any 8.x release should not come with major compatibility issues.

Highlights:

  - Mature and feature-rich tabling support including _well founded
    semantics_, _incremental tabling_, _monotonic tabling_ and
    _shared tabling_.
  - Single sided unification [SSU](/pldoc/man?section=ssu) and zero-cost
    runtime determinism checking.  See also `$/0`, `$/1` and det/1.
  - Database _transactions_ see transaction/1 and snapshot/1.
  - A new C++ interface that covers the whole foreign API and provides
    much better type safety.
  - Linux versions are by default linked to
    [tcmalloc](https://github.com/google/tcmalloc).  This provides more
    information and control and reduces the footprint of multi-threaded
    7x7 servers considerably compared to the default ptmalloc.
  - Interfaces to [Redis](https://redis.io/) and
    [STOMP](http://stomp.github.io/) message passing systems.
  - A port to WASM [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) allows running
    SWI-Prolog in the browser.  The high level bi-directional interfaces
    to JavaScript allows for inspecting and modifying the browser DOM.
  - A completely new GNU-Emacs package called
    [sweep](https://eshelyaron.com/sweep.html).  Sweep embeds Prolog, which
    allows for _semantic highlighting_ and much more.
  - A bundled replacement for [GMP](https://gmplib.org/), providing
    unbounded integers and rational numbers based on
    [LibBF](https://bellard.org/libbf/) under a permissive license.
    Currently significantly slower on notably larger rational numbers.
